# Webcam tablet
Turns ordinary webcam into a simple drawing tablet.

## General info
The main goal of this project is to make simple drawing tablet, using cheap and commonly used items. Nowadays almost everyone has a webcam so the idea is to use it in a creative way and make a useful tool. I believe that with appropriate software it will be possible to make a drawing tablet only with a camera,a sheet of paper and any pen or pointer. It could be very handy especially for remote work or education. The project is in very early phase but the results are promising. You could see the actual operation on the GIF below. The aplication is written in Python and uses OpenCV library. It receives a point of contact by perspective transformation and many other conversions aplied to an image. It also uses some maths calculations to optimize and smooth drawing. More details and instructions how to setup the programme will be provided during development.
